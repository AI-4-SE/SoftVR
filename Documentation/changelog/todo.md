  - [ ] Opening & joining sessions from within the application (maybe in entry room)
  - [ ] Show an avatar for each user that only the other person can see

## Minor
- [X] Enable/Disable all visualizations in UI (includes graphs) *(10.07.2019)*
- [X] Improve overview texture generation by NOT pre-calculating line patterns *(17.07.2019)*
- [X] Nodes rotating towards parent node in cone tree layout *(05.08.2019)*
- [X] Generic code for cone tree layout used by software hierarchy visualization and variability model *(05.08.2019)*
  - [X] Cleanup example scenes accordingly after this modification! *(08.08.2019)*
- [X] Apply minimal cone tree layout algorithm to variability model as well *(06.08.2019)*
- [X] Better font for code in code window (e.g. Consolas - type "monospace" font) *(08.08.2019)*
- [X] **#1** Same color coding for cone tree edges and code city *(21.08.2019)*
- [X] **#3** Improved scrolling using a gesture *(16.08.2019)*
- [X] **#3** Scroll wheel texture and rotation *(22.08.2019)*
- [X] **#1** Add raycast to check that code city hover window is not inside building *(22.08.2019)*
- [ ] Horizontal scrolling with new scroll-wheel implementation
- [ ] ValueMappings: provide some default color methods for usage in mappings
- [ ] ValueMappingsLoader: refactoring and generalization of setting types
- [ ] \(Sorting files in cone tree layout by their type to get kinda like a pie chart when color is applied\)?
- [ ] Put overview texture generation in a coroutine to minimize performance impact
- [ ] Improve code overview for the case that there are too many lines resulting in less than one pixel on the texture
- [ ] VariabilityModelSpawner: improve option index retrieval in last version (see comments in code)
- [ ] Add possibility to enable/disable code/region overview window
- [ ] Add possibility to show/hide code or regions or both in overview window?
- [ ] Tilt hover window of directory graph to user
- [ ] Hints on interaction when user selects a tool for the first time
- [ ] Hints on interaction while using the tools
- [ ] Feature graph: enable parent node if child node activated
  - [ ] Automated check/validation of alternate group selection
  - [ ] **#2** Selecting and configuring numerical options (requires UI concerns)
- [ ] Possibility to zoom on text for better readability
- [ ] Feature regions counter to show amount of "affected" lines
- [ ] Instant snap to start/end of file instead of "endless" scrolling
- [ ] Improve edge rendering to avoid thin edges when they curve
- [ ] Edges with lighting for better depth clues
- [ ] Improve pointing at files far away (e.g. searching inside a radius)
- [ ] Allow teleport when laser pointer is disabled
- [ ] Notation hints on feature graph (e.g. on hover)
- [ ] Information about edges (e.g. on hover)
  - [ ] Type and value/weight of edge
  - [ ] Classes/files to connect between
  - [ ] Line numbers (in code) to connect to
- [ ] Improve counting of edges (add numbers or similar to show)
- [ ] Advanced positioning and rotating of code windows (snap to..., rotate with respect to...)
- [ ] Code cleanup

## Bugs
- [X] NullPointerException when calling "WindowSpawnedCallback" function with no CodeFile *(12.07.2019)*
- [X] Last line number not shown in code file *(12.07.2019)*

- [X] **#1** State of nodes of the variability model not always updating properly *(22.08.2019)*
- [X] Changing controller while pointing at folders/files does not change back color of marked folder/file *(22.08.2019)*
- [X] **#1** Fix code city not having pointer collision *(28.08.2019)* (caused by input module having different layer mask)
- [ ] **#1** Overview region sometimes shown black
- [ ] Overview window scroll for code and regions is hacky and sometimes wobbles a bit
- [ ] Laser pointer sometimes not working right after startup (rare)
- [ ] Horizontal scrollbar of code window is often not adjusting the content
