Major changes for version 0.1.1:

[11.06.2019]
- SNode now holds a reference to the CodeFile
  -> to avoid additional calls and retrievals using the StructureLoader class

[12.06.2019]
- Refactoring of spawner system
  - Spawners can now be retrieved from the ApplicationLoader using their name
  - Only spawners that are registered in the ApplicationLoader component are usable
  - Spawners can have "sub-spawners" (e.g. FileSpawner has the EdgeSpawner and RegionsSpawner)
  - "Sub-spawners" can be retrieved through spawner classes using GetSpawner() and e.g. the FileSpawner.SpawnerList enum
  - Spawners can be set to be run on startup or not in the ApplicationLoader component
